Downloads a layer of GeoTIFFs from the [NYPL Map Warper](http://maps.nypl.org).

The NYPL Map Warper allows registered users to download rectified GeoTIFFs of individual maps, but not of complete map layers. This fixes that.

HOWTO
=====
1. [Register a Mapwarper account](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/users/new)
2. Download layerdownloader.py to the folder you want to download the images to.3. Enter the [map layer](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/layers) you're looking to download.
4. Enter your username & password.
5. Wait whilst your maps download (yes I know you can change the paramaters to download it faster, but we've only got one maps fileserver. Please don't murder it.).
